        <p>I am a second-year MPhys <span class="pizazz">Astrophysics student at the University of Leicester</span> with a strong foundation in coding and STEM outreach. I am committed to a career in astrophysics and space research, and am particularly interested in astronomical phenomena beyond the solar system, such as AGNs and supermassive black holes. I also take a particular interest in longtermism and the advancement of humanity’s progress with regards to space exploration, but my interests lean more towards the stars themselves rather than the rockets that could get us there.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I am the <span class="pizazz">President of PauseAI's Leicester branch,</span> an organisation that focusses on lowering existential risk from artificial superintelligence.</p>
        <p>I am currently applying for research roles, both year-long and summer ones.</p>
        <p>You can contact me at last name first name (a t) proton (d o t) me. My full CV is available upon request.</p>
        <p>My personal blog can be found at <a href="https://stellarstreamgalactica.substack.com/">StellarStreamGalactica</a>.</p>
