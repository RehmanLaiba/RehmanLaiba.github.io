    <h1>Laiba Rehman</h1>
        <p>I am a second-year Astrophysics undergraduate student at the University of Leicester with a strong foundation in coding and STEM outreach. I am committed to a career in astrophysics and space research, and am particularly interested in astronomical phenomena beyond the solar system, such as AGNs and supermassive black holes. I also take a particular interest in the advancement of humanityâ€™s progress with regards to space exploration, but my interests lean more towards the stars themselves rather than the rockets that could get us there.</p>
        <p>I am currently applying for research roles, both year-long and summer ones.</p>
        <p>You can contact me at last name first name (a t) proton (d o t) me. My full CV is available upon request.</p>
