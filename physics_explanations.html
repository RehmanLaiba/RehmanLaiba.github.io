    <h1>Physics Explanations</h1>
    <div>
        This is where I put some lightly edited versions of my notes. Most of my longform notes follow the source material very closely; I do not put those there. Occasionally, though, some of my notes feel more like my own thoughts on a topic rather than direct notes, and I have put some snippets of these on this page. Note that within my Obsidian database they would link to other detailed notes (that are heavily based on the source material and, therefore, not included here) so some context is necessarily missing.

        <h2>On Venus, the stars rise later each night</h2>

        Original Obsidian file name: Venus' retrograde rotation, stars rise later each night
        Tags: #astrophysics #physics #orbital_mechanics

        Each night, the stars rise 4 minutes earlier. The Earth takes approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds to rotate once relative to the background stars, i.e. the length of time between one star crossing the meridian, then crossing it again. However, it takes a little longer than this, approximately 24 hours, for the Sun to re-cross the meridian, because during this period the Earth has also been moving around the Sun in its orbit. Therefore, the Earth has to rotate a little extra, approximately 1º, for the Sun to be on the meridian again. It takes roughly 4 minutes for Earth to rotate 1º, hence, the stars rise 4 minutes "earlier" each day, in comparison the Sun and our usual clocks (which measure solar time). (The stars do not experience this effect due to their great distance.)
        
        This phenomenon—the stars rising earlier each night—applies to most planets. However, it does not apply to Venus. Venus has retrograde rotation. (If we define its orbit as anticlockwise, its rotation is clockwise.) Therefore, the Sun reaches the meridian again *before* the stars do, and the stars rise *later* each night compared to the Sun.
